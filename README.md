# Azure-Day-32-firewall-enterprise

Project Overview
This project focused on implementing Azure Firewall within an existing multi-VNet architecture to create centralized network security policies and traffic inspection capabilities. 
The implementation demonstrated both the power and complexity of enterprise-grade network security solutions in Azure.

Architecture Implementation
Azure Firewall Deployment
Building on Day 31's multi-VNet peering architecture, this project added enterprise-grade firewall protection to create a comprehensive security infrastructure.

Infrastructure Components
Existing Foundation (Day 31)
1. DevelopmentVNet: 192.168.0.0/16 with web and database tiers
2. ProductionVNet: 172.16.0.0/16 with web and database tiers
3. VNet Peering: Secure connectivity between environments
4. Virtual Machines: DevWebServer01 and ProdWebServer01

New Security Layer (Day 32)
1. Azure Firewall: Standard tier firewall appliance
2. AzureFirewallSubnet: Dedicated subnet (172.16.0.192/26) for firewall deployment
3. Firewall Public IP: External connectivity endpoint
4. Security Rule Collections: Application and network-level traffic policies
5. Route Table: Custom routing to direct traffic through firewall

Security Policy Configuration
Application Rules
* Rule Collection: AllowWebTraffic
* Priority: 200
* Action: Allow
* Scope: Both VNet address spaces (192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/16)
* Allowed Destinations: *.microsoft.com, *.azure.com
* Protocol: HTTPS (443)

Network Rules
* Rule Collection: AllowInterVNetTraffic
* Priority: 200
* Action: Allow
* Traffic Flow: Development VNet to Production VNet
* Protocol: Any
* Ports: All

Advanced Routing Implementation
* Custom Route Table: FirewallRouteTable
* Default Route: 0.0.0.0/0 â†’ Virtual Appliance (172.16.3.4)
* Applied Subnets: DevWebTier, ProdWebTier
* Purpose: Force internet-bound traffic through firewall inspection

Enterprise Networking Insights
* Real-World Complexity Encountered
This project provided authentic enterprise networking experience by encountering the types of routing complexities common in production Azure environments:

Route Propagation Challenges
* Issue: Custom routes not immediately effective despite correct configuration
* Analysis: Network Watcher diagnostics showed traffic using System Routes instead of custom FirewallRouteTable
* Enterprise Reality: Route table changes in complex networking environments require propagation time and sometimes additional configuration refinement

Diagnostic Methodology Applied
* Tool Used: Azure Network Watcher Connection Troubleshoot
* Systematic Approach: Analyzed connectivity, NSG rules, and route resolution
* Results Interpretation:
    * NSG Diagnostics: Allow (security rules correct)
    * Route Resolution: System Route instead of custom route (indicates routing complexity)
    * Next Hop Analysis: Internet instead of Virtual Appliance (shows route not yet effective)

Troubleshooting Analysis
* Connectivity Test Results:
* Source: DevWebServer01 (192.168.1.x)
* Destination: 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS)
* NSG Analysis: Outbound communication allowed
* Routing Behavior: Traffic using Internet route instead of Virtual Appliance
* Next Steps: Additional route table configuration refinement required
